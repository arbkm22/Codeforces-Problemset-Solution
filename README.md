<h1>Codeforces Problemset Solutions</h1>
<h3>I'm solving problems according to the difficulty level, in ascending order.</h3>
<br>
<h3>These may not be the optimal solutions, but these pass the test cases without any TLE.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Some problems may be incomplete.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Also, some problems may fail the test cases, idk why, but they pass the same on my machine with the same test cases.</h3>
<h3>If you have better solutions than mine, then please feel free to contribute.</h3>
